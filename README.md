# Chaser Game
A fun game written by Hayden Crabbs, Danhee Kim, and Jack Mauro. It can be played here:

This is our final project for CMSI 185. Our game is called "Sunglasses Chase!" and the player can be operated using the WASD keys. The player is a gremlin wearing Dr. Toal's sunglasses, and the enemies are the Dr. Toals chasing after the player. He has to get his sunglasses back somehow, right?

The objective of the game is to survive through as many "waves" as you can before losing all of your health. As the "waves" increases, more Dr. Toals will appear in the game.

There are several additional components in the gameplay:
1. Scarecrow: This is activated when the player presses the spacebar. For 5 seconds, all of the enemies will be sucked into a tornado. Another tornado can be activated 10 seconds after the last tornado has been in play.
2. Powerup: When the player runs into the heart, the player will receive a health boost. Powerups appear every 10 seconds after one has been used.
3. Bomb: When the player runs into a bomb, 3 Dr. Toals will be removed from gameplay. Bombs appear every 20 seconds after one has been used.

Additionally, our game has a "pause" button on the upper right hand corner in which the game will be paused once the button is pushed. The game can be resumed by pushing the same button again.
